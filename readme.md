# Todo list/Known issues:
- Ogerpon Teal Mask not added yet, using DNA Splicer for now
- Lightbulb is a placeholder texture, I'll get sth better
- Genesects Form Change is purely visual since Techno Blast doesn't change Typing
- Arceus' Judgement doesn't change typing
- If I make enough money through AllTheMegas & Rotom Appliances I'll hire someone to make the items have their buffs
  - Cuz apparently that's way more complicated than I assumed

# How to uninstall/revert back to ATM Ultimate's evolutions:
- Delete Antithetic from `/mods`
- Delete ATM Ultimate from `\resourcepacks` and `\saves\[YOURWORLDNAME]\datapacks`
- Re-download a fresh version of ATM Ultimate and install
