# How to install this Mod correctly!:

1. **Download the latest version of the mod *(from releases, **not** code)***
    - Note that it's Fabric only _(works fine with Sinytra Connector tho!)_
    - Put it in `\mods`


2. **Download the latest override *(from [here](https://discord.com/channels/1014582959480774666/1345518292525121536/1345603120960372737))***


3. **Navigate to `\saves\[YOURWORLDNAME]\datapacks\ATM Ultimate`**
   - Make sure AllTheMons Ultimate is **unzipped**
   - Drag both the data folders from the `OVERRIDE.zip` into ATM - Ultimate's base folder
       - *(Where assets, data, documentation etc. are)*
   - It will ask to `override 68 files`, click `yes`
   - If not, you made a mistake and need to undo or reinstall ATM - Ultimate


PS: _(You have to repeat step 3 *every time* you update ATM - Ultimate!)_

# Todo list/Known issues:
- Ogerpon Teal Mask not added yet, using DNA Splicer for now
- Lightbulb is a placeholder texture, I'll get sth better
- If I make enough money through AllTheMegas & Rotom Appliances I'll hire someone to make the items have their buffs
  - Cuz apparently a lil more complicated than I assumed

# How to uninstall/revert back to ATM Ultimate's evolutions:
- Delete Antithetic from `/mods`
- Delete ATM Ultimate from `\saves\[YOURWORLDNAME]\datapacks`
- Re-download a fresh version of ATM Ultimate and install
